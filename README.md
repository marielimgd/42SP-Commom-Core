# Welcome to My 42 School Projects Repository! ðŸŽ“

This repository contains all the projects I am working on during my journey at **42 School**. Here, you'll find my solutions to various challenges and exercises presented throughout the program. As I progress through the curriculum, this repository will be regularly updated with my new projects and milestones.

42 School is a **peer-to-peer, project-based learning** program that promotes autonomy, problem-solving skills, and student collaboration. There are no formal teachers â€” students learn through projects, code reviews, and peer evaluations.
